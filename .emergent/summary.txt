The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive frontend for the UpnaFesta application, cloning the functionality of weduploader.com and uploadfesta.incorporetreinamentos.com.br using React, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI components. The approach involved an initial frontend-first development with extensive mock data to demonstrate features and UX. The engineer iteratively refined the application based on detailed user feedback across multiple turns. Key decisions included structuring the application with distinct client, admin, and guest interfaces, implementing a mock payment approval flow, and enhancing customization options. Challenges included fixing lint errors and adapting to a blocked URL for design reference. The work culminated in a robust, mocked frontend ready for backend integration, with the last task focusing on correcting Google OAuth simulation, multi-album data consistency, and date handling.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to clone weduploader.com and uploadfesta.incorporetreinamentos.com.br as UpnaFesta, with a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack.
Key features include:
- A management console for the product owner to create client accounts, view self-service registrations, and fully customize the main landing page (photos, layout, texts, etc.).
- A client-specific page for customizing their album (colors, main photo, messages, Google Drive integration for photo storage). Clients can create one album initially, with the possibility of multiple albums (later requested). Album creation requires admin payment approval.
- A public guest upload page accessible via URL/QR code, allowing photo uploads directly to the client's Google Drive. This page should resemble .
- The system must be stateless for AWS Linux hosting, storing all persistent data in MariaDB (AWS RDS).
- Sensitive credentials (tokens) for clients must be in MariaDB; system credentials in AWS Secrets.
- Unique links for each album. URLs should not be hardcoded, managed via MariaDB settings.
- Initial requests included removing Free labels, correcting button redirects, refining admin access (dedicated login, removal of public admin button), improving client login redirection, enhancing site management (add How It Works and Testimonials customization with carousel option).
- Subsequent corrections focused on Google OAuth wizard simulation, multi-album support per client, client/admin logout, client enable/disable, admin client editing, and a two-step guest upload flow with name/comment fields, and a full-page gradient background for the guest page.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (initially, later MariaDB).
- **Frontend-First Development:** Extensive use of  for rapid prototyping without a functional backend.
- **Component-Based UI:** Leveraging Shadcn UI components for modern design.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Implemented with React Router DOM for multi-page navigation.
- **Environment Variables:** Strict usage for API URLs and database connections.
- **Iterative Development:** Continuous refinement based on user feedback.
- **Simulated OAuth:** Mocking Google OAuth flow for client Google Drive integration.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure:


- ****:
  - **Importance**: Centralized source of all mock data for frontend development, simulating backend responses.
  - **Changes**: Heavily updated to include data for various pages (homepage content, client accounts, admin users, album details, testimonials, How It Works sections), support for multi-album clients, ,  status, , and Google OAuth simulation states. This file is crucial for the frontend's current functionality.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main React application entry point, setting up routing with  and demonstrating basic Axios calls to the backend (currently just a Hello World).
  - **Changes**: Minimal changes, primarily involving route definitions and initial setup.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main public landing page for the UpnaFesta application, showcasing features, pricing, and testimonials.
  - **Changes**: Significant modifications to remove Free labels, adjust button texts and their redirection logic (to ), implement smooth scrolling for How It Works, and dynamically render content (features, testimonials, pricing) based on  data configurable via .

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Handles user authentication for both clients and administrators.
  - **Changes**: Updated to manage distinct login flows for clients and admins, redirecting clients to  and admins to  upon successful mock login.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: A newly created dedicated login page for administrative access.
  - **Changes**: New file creation to provide a separate login interface for administrators with predefined mock credentials (/).

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The central console for administrators to manage clients, payments, and site content.
  - **Changes**: Extensively modified to include client management features (create, delete, reset password, enable/disable), payment approval/rejection logic, a configurable album limit per client, and a dedicated logout button. Recent edits focused on removing wedding date info and supporting multi-album client data.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The personalized dashboard for clients to manage their album(s) and Google Drive integration.
  - **Changes**: Significantly refactored to support multiple albums per client with tabbed navigation (Share, Personalize, Settings), simulate Google OAuth flow, allow setting a  per album, provide options for creating/deleting albums based on admin-set limits, and include logout and password reset functionalities.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The public-facing page where wedding guests upload photos and videos.
  - **Changes**: Redesigned to closely mimic  with a full-page gradient background, a larger photo of the couple overlaid on the gradient (removing the white box), and a two-step upload process requiring guest name and an optional comment before file upload.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Allows administrators to customize the public  content dynamically.
  - **Changes**: Enhanced to include configurable sections for How It Works (title, subtitle, steps) and Testimonials (enable/disable, add/edit/delete testimonials with couple's name, text, and photo).

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Serves as a technical specification and protocol for backend development and frontend-backend integration.
  - **Changes**: Created to outline API contracts, mock data to be replaced, backend implementation details, and integration strategy.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The FastAPI backend entry point, currently with minimal API routes and MongoDB setup.
  - **Changes**: Remains largely unchanged from the initial template, providing a basic  prefix, CORS configuration, and a Hello World endpoint, along with placeholder CRUD for  objects.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: A reusable Shadcn UI component for tabbed navigation.
  - **Changes**: No direct changes to this file, but its usage was integrated into  and .

<pending_tasks>
- **Backend Development:** Implement actual MariaDB models, CRUD operations, Google Drive API integration (true OAuth and file storage), and replace all mock data.
- **Deployment Automation:** Create AWS CloudFormation scripts and detailed manual steps for AWS deployment.
- **Testimonial Carousel:** Implement the carousel functionality for testimonials on the homepage (currently a responsive grid).
- **Automated Testing:** Conduct  and  runs once backend is implemented.

<current_work>
Currently, the focus is on resolving critical issues reported in the frontend, specifically related to the Google account configuration, album data consistency, and date management.
The previous AI engineer was in the process of fixing:
1.  **Google OAuth Simulation**: The user noted that the Google account configuration was just an email field, not a simulated OAuth flow. The AI engineer is updating  to show a more realistic OAuth simulation.
2.  **Album Data Inconsistency**: The user observed a client having an album with  status, which implies a functional issue or mock data inconsistency.
3.  **Per-Album Dates**: The requirement is that each album should have its own date, not a single wedding date for the client. This necessitates changes in how album data is structured and displayed in  and .
4.  **Admin Dashboard Data**: The wedding date information in the admin client list was deemed irrelevant given the multi-album feature and was requested to be removed from .

At the end of the trajectory, the AI engineer was attempting to finalize the  corrections, specifically removing the wedding date column, after encountering and resolving some ESLint parsing errors during the process of updating the file. The  and  have already received updates for multi-album support and Google OAuth simulation.
