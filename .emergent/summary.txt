The AI engineer's work primarily focused on transitioning the UpnaFesta application from a mock-based frontend to a fully integrated Google Drive API solution using FastAPI and MariaDB, while continuously addressing user-reported bugs and UX issues. The process involved extensive backend development (MariaDB schema, Google OAuth flow, file upload), frontend adjustments for real API calls, and iterative bug fixes. Key challenges included correcting Google OAuth logic (redirect URIs, scopes), ensuring data consistency between frontend and backend, managing MariaDB state, and refining the user experience for Google Drive configuration and album management, including issues with the Folder ID field and automated folder creation. The final interactions show a persistent bug with empty Folder ID not saving correctly, indicating a need for further backend validation.

The UpnaFesta application aims to clone features from weduploader.com and uploadfesta.incorporetreinamentos.com.br using a React/FastAPI/MariaDB stack. Core features include an admin console for client and site content management, client-specific dashboards for album customization and Google Drive integration, and a public guest upload page. The system must be stateless, storing data in MariaDB (AWS RDS) with sensitive credentials managed securely. Initial requirements involved refining UI elements, login flows, and site content customization. Recent iterations focused on robust Google OAuth simulation, multi-album support, client/admin logout, and a two-step guest upload. The ongoing work involves implementing a real Google Drive API integration, ensuring all Google-related settings (Client ID, Secret, Callback URL) are configurable via the admin UI and stored in MariaDB, and that client tokens are saved securely in MariaDB for actual file uploads. Album dates must be per-album, not per-client.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes**: Extended significantly to include MariaDB integration, new API routes for Google Drive configuration (), Google OAuth (, ), client management, album updates (including ), and a  endpoint. Models for database interaction (, , , ) are defined or imported.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles MariaDB database connection and SQLAlchemy models.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created to define  for SQLAlchemy, and , , , , ,  models with their respective table schemas. Includes logic for creating database tables.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Encapsulates all Google Drive API interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Newly created. Contains  class with methods for OAuth authentication, token refreshing, file uploads, and creating Google Drive folders. Handles required API scopes.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: New admin page for Google Cloud API credential setup.
    -   **Changes**: New file creation. Provides UI to input  and . Dynamically displays the correct redirect URI for Google Cloud Console setup. Iteratively refined to simplify the UI and provide accurate instructions.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Admin console.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to include a link/button to the new  page. Debugged visibility issues of this button.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Client-facing dashboard for album and Google Drive management.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified to integrate with real backend APIs for Google OAuth, album data fetching, updating album dates, and managing Google Folder IDs. Initially used mock data but transitioned to real backend calls. Iteratively refined the Google Drive connection UX, including removal of Folder ID input from the initial connection dialog, adding a Save Configuration button, and implementing auto-focus on the Folder ID field after successful Google connection. Removed  from Folder ID input. Also, fixed issues with  logic.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main React router setup.
    -   **Changes**: Added routes for the new  page.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides mock data for frontend development.
    -   **Changes**: Temporarily modified to control  status for testing real OAuth flow, and to simulate client/album data consistency. Data was manually inserted into MariaDB to match mock IDs for testing.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Technical specification.
    -   **Changes**: Not directly modified in this trajectory, but its initial purpose was to define contracts.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug where the Folder ID field in the client's Settings tab was not correctly saving empty or newly input values, and the previous changes were reverting the Folder ID to a default/fake value upon refresh. This was traced to a backend issue where the  field was missing from the  Pydantic model.

The engineer made the following changes and observations:
1.  **Fixed Folder ID saving:** Corrected the  model in  to include , ensuring the backend correctly receives and saves the provided Folder ID.
2.  **UI for Folder ID:** Removed the auto-save functionality for the Folder ID field in  and replaced it with a manual Salvar Configuração (Save Configuration) button, positioned as requested above the Excluir Este Álbum button. The field was also changed to a  to allow multi-line input and remove character limitations.
3.  **Simplified Google Drive Dialog:** Removed the ID da Pasta field and Salvar ID da Pasta button from the  dialog () to streamline the Google connection UX, leaving only Teste Real Upload and Desconectar buttons. This was to centralize Folder ID configuration to the Settings tab.
4.  **UX Enhancement:** Implemented a visual alert (red background, prominent message) in the Google connection dialog to instruct users to configure the Folder ID in the Settings tab after successful connection. After connection, the system now automatically refreshes the page, navigates to the Configurações tab, and focuses on the Folder ID input field.
5.  **Automated Folder Creation:** Implemented backend logic () to automatically create a Google Drive folder if the  is left empty when attempting an upload.
6.  **Persistent Bug:** A critical bug where deleting the Folder ID (making it empty) and saving still results in the Folder ID reappearing after a refresh was the last reported issue. This implies the backend is not correctly handling empty string updates for the  or the frontend is not sending empty strings for that field.

Investigate and fix the bug where deleting the Folder ID and saving does not persist the empty value after refresh.
